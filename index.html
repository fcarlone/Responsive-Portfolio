          Hello. Welcome to my website. Here are some details about me. My name is Frank Carlone (as you can see from
          the site title). I been living in Philadelphia, PA for over twenty years - I'm originally from Brick, New
          Jersey. I attended college in Philadelphia and fell in love with the city from the first day of school. The
          city offered more variety than the suburbs of New Jersey.
        </p>
        <p>
          My current passion is software development. I'm currently attending the Penn LPS boot camp. Hopefully after
          the 24-week boot camp ends, I will be employed (or at least employable) as I Software Developer - working long
          hours but on something fascinating.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also enjoy running up-and-down Schuylkill Banks (need to do more of it), hiking around the Poconos and
          traveling (who doesn’t)
        </p>

          Feel free to checkout my website. View the portfolio of cats. Just one warning, don’t waste your time feeling
          the contact information – it doesn’t do anything.
